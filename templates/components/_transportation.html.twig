                    Driving to Berlin with a car would take approximately 7.5 hours. You can take up to 5 people in your car. It is more environmental friendly than the plane, but for example a bus or train would take more people at once.

                    Taking the train has te least CO2 emissions. This is because all the trains in the Netherlands are currently CO2-neutral. The energy which is used to power the trains are from wind turbines. For countries other than the netherlands. The CO2 emmissions per person are lower than car, bus or plane. This is because the number of passengers is much higher with a plane.

                    Taking a plane for a destination closeby is extremely polluting. It maybe the fastest transportation option, but flying one person is an emission of 330 kg CO2! Going with a car, with 4 people, the pollution is 150kg CO2. If you go with a car it would be more environmentally friendly, a train even more! The compensation fee is calculated km times 0.10â‚¬. This will be used to plant trees.
